## Support for deploying and using Kubernetes

Welcome to Kubernetes! We use GitHub for tracking bugs and feature requests.
This isn't the right place to get support for using Kubernetes, but the following
resources are available below, thanks for understanding.

### Documentation: For Everyone

* [Kubernetes Documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/)
* [Monitoring, Logging, and Debugging](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/debug/) guides

### Real-time Chat: For Beginners

* [Slack](https://kubernetes.slack.com) ([registration](https://slack.k8s.io)):
The `#kubernetes-users` and `#kubernetes-novice` channels are common places where
people offer support. If you are completely new to k8s, join this community.
You will surely get help from members and regular contributors there.
**We welcome new participants.**
